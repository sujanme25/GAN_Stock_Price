A Generative Adversarial Network (GAN) is a type of neural network architecture introduced by Ian Goodfellow and his colleagues in 2014. GANs consist of two main components: a generator and a discriminator. The goal of a GAN is to generate new data samples that are similar to a given training dataset.

Here's a basic overview of how GANs work:

Generator (G): The generator takes random noise as input and generates synthetic data samples. The goal is to generate data that is indistinguishable from real data.

Discriminator (D): The discriminator evaluates whether a given data sample is real (from the training set) or fake (generated by the generator). Its goal is to correctly classify the origin of the input data.

Training Process:

During training, the generator and discriminator are trained simultaneously in a competitive manner.
The generator tries to improve its ability to generate realistic data to fool the discriminator.
The discriminator aims to become more accurate in distinguishing between real and generated data.
This adversarial process continues until the generator produces data that is almost indistinguishable from real data.
Loss Function:

The generator and discriminator have opposing objectives, and their performances are measured using a loss function.
The generator aims to minimize the probability of the discriminator correctly classifying its generated data as fake.
The discriminator aims to maximize the probability of correctly classifying both real and generated data.

Training Steps:

The training process involves alternating steps between updating the generator and updating the discriminator.
Typically, the generator is updated to minimize its loss, followed by an update to the discriminator to minimize its loss.
